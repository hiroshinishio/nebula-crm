## Key Decisions

- **Mental model:** "My Work" + "Assigned By Me" tabs (not team queue or region view)
- **Assignment:** DistributionManager and Admin only; other roles self-assign only
- **Visibility:** Ownership-based (assignee or creator), not region-based
- **Status changes:** Assignee-only (managers cannot complete tasks on behalf of others)
- **Bulk actions:** Deferred to Phase 2
- **Out-of-office:** Deferred to Phase 2
