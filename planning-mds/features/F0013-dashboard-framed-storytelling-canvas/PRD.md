# F0013: Dashboard Framed Storytelling Canvas

**Feature ID:** F0013
**Feature Name:** Dashboard Framed Storytelling Canvas
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** MVP
**Status:** Done (Decision A override; active folder retained)
**Corrects:** F0012 (archived), F0011 (abandoned), F0010 (abandoned)

## Feature Statement

**As a** Distribution User, Underwriter, Relationship Manager, Program Manager, or Admin
**I want** the dashboard presented as a framed storytelling canvas — the app chrome (nav, rails, top bar) forms the frame, operational panels (nudges, activity, tasks) float with depth and glow, and the opportunity flow tells its story as a vertical timeline where each stage has a contextual mini-visualization that best fits that stage's narrative
**So that** I get the best of both worlds: the polished framed-canvas identity of the original dashboard design and the narrative storytelling power of an infographic timeline where each stop tells its own chapter of the submission journey

## Design Philosophy

> **Framed canvas, not flat poster.** The app chrome (left nav, right Neuron rail, top bar) forms a visible frame. Inside the frame, the dashboard is a canvas with three visual layers — not one flat surface.

### Three-Layer Visual Hierarchy

| Layer | Treatment | Components |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Frame** | App chrome — solid edges, always present | Left nav rail, right Neuron rail, top bar |
| **Operational panels** | Glass-card, float/raised depth, soft hover/focus glow | Nudge cards, Activity panel, My Tasks panel |
| **Story canvas** | Flat infographic zone — vertical timeline, contextual mini-visuals, chapter overlays | Opportunity flow, KPI band, chapter controls |

Key principles:
- **Operational panels keep their identity** — nudge cards, Activity, and My Tasks use `glass-card` with depth and the soft violet/fuchsia hover glow from the design system. They float above the canvas.
- **Story canvas is the infographic zone** — the opportunity flow area between KPI band and Activity is where the storytelling lives. This zone is flat, borderless, and narrative.
- **Vertical timeline, not table cells** — the opportunity flow renders as a vertical timeline spine with stage nodes alternating left and right, inspired by `pipeline5.png` and `handdrawn-timeline.jpeg`.
- **Contextual mini-visualizations** — each stage node on the timeline has a mini-visualization chosen to best tell that stage's story. One stop might be a donut (composition), another a mini bar chart (broker distribution), another a gauge (SLA health). The chart type is selected per-stage based on what's most meaningful, not forced to be uniform.
- **Size proportional to volume** — mini-visuals scale with the stage's item count. A stage with 300 items gets a larger visual than a stage with 2.
- **Chapters as uniform override** — chapter controls (Flow/Friction/Outcomes) override the contextual defaults and force ALL stops to show the same dimension for cross-stage comparison. Aging and mix dimensions are handled via per-stop alternate toggles (S0003) rather than global chapters.
- **Editorial palette** — muted coral + steel blue accent pair on deep navy (dark) or warm gray (light), inspired by `pipeline5.png` and `pipeline4.png`. Replaces the neon violet/fuchsia SaaS palette with a calmer data-journalism tone.
- **Dark-first** — dark product theme with lower visual noise; light theme parity maintained.

### What F0012 Got Wrong

F0012 interpreted "infographic" as "flatten everything." It stripped borders, depth, and glow from ALL dashboard components — including operational panels (nudges, activity, tasks) that need those identity elements to feel interactive and purposeful. The result lost the framed-canvas feel shown in the original handdrawn wireframe (`planning-mds/screens/handdrawn.jpeg`).

### What This Feature Corrects

1. **Restores glass-card / depth / glow** on nudge cards, Activity panel, and My Tasks panel.
2. **Restores the framed canvas identity** — the nav/rails/top bar act as a frame enclosing the dashboard canvas.
3. **Replaces flat rectangular stage cells** with a vertical timeline where each stop has a contextual mini-visualization (donut, bar chart, gauge, etc.) chosen to best fit that stage's narrative.
4. **Keeps what F0012 got right** — chapter controls, period synchronization, collapsible rails, connected flow concept, terminal outcome branches.

## Business Objective

- **Goal:** Restore dashboard visual identity while improving opportunity flow storytelling with timeline-bar and radial-chart visualization.
- **Metric:**
  - Median time-to-identify top bottleneck stage (via radial popover scan)
  - Drilldown open rate from radial popover interactions
  - User satisfaction with framed-canvas feel vs. flat-canvas feel (A/B or stakeholder review)
- **Baseline:** F0012 implemented a fully flat canvas that lost depth, glow, and framed identity on operational panels. Opportunity flow uses flat rectangular cells with counts.
- **Target:** Restore framed-canvas identity with three-layer visual hierarchy. Replace flat cells with timeline-bar + radial popovers that reveal composition, not just counts.

## Problem Statement

- **Current State:** F0012 flattened everything — nudge cards, activity, and tasks lost their glass-card depth and glow. The opportunity flow is a row of flat rectangular cells showing counts. The dashboard no longer feels like a framed canvas with depth.
- **Desired State:** The dashboard feels like a framed canvas: app chrome (left nav, right Neuron rail, top bar) sits flush to viewport edges, the main content area is enclosed in a bordered inset container with rounded corners (sidebar-08 pattern), operational panels float with depth and glow inside that container, and the story canvas zone tells the opportunity narrative through a timeline bar with radial chart popovers at each stage.
- **Impact:** Restores the polished, purposeful feel of the original design while adding richer data visualization (composition via radials, not just counts).

## Scope & Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Restore glass-card, float/raised depth, and soft hover/focus glow on nudge cards, Activity panel, and My Tasks panel.
- Replace flat rectangular opportunity flow cells with a vertical timeline (spine top-to-bottom, stops alternating left-right).
- Each timeline stop has a contextual mini-visualization — the chart type (donut, bar chart, gauge, progress ring, etc.) is chosen per-stage to best tell that stage's story.
- Mini-visualization size scales proportionally with the stage's item count.
- Chapter controls (Flow/Friction/Outcomes) override contextual defaults — switching chapters forces all stops to show the same dimension for uniform cross-stage comparison.
- Terminal outcome branches render at the timeline bottom (keeping the connected flow semantics from F0012).
- Per-stop alternate view toggles (S0003) allow exploring different dimensions (geography, broker breakdown, aging, etc.) at individual stops.
- Maintain period synchronization (30d / 90d / 180d / 365d) across KPIs, timeline, and radial data.
- KPI band remains as inline flat content within the story canvas zone (no card borders on KPIs).
- Maintain collapsible left nav and right Neuron rail with adaptive canvas width.
- Responsive behavior across desktop (1280+), tablet landscape (1024), tablet portrait (768), phone (375).
- Maintain all F0012 backend contract changes (periodDays on KPIs, avgDwellDays + emphasis on flow nodes).

**Out of Scope:**
- Workflow status taxonomy changes for submissions/renewals.
- AI recommendation logic changes inside Neuron rail.
- New external BrokerUser dashboard surfaces.
- Global navigation IA redesign beyond dashboard layout behavior.
- Adding new backend endpoints — this feature uses existing endpoints from F0010/F0012.
- Changing the chapter set (Flow/Friction/Outcomes remains the same).

## Acceptance Criteria Overview

- [ ] Nudge cards render with glass-card treatment, depth, and soft hover/focus glow.
- [ ] Activity panel renders as a raised/float panel with glass-card and glow.
- [ ] My Tasks panel renders as a raised/float panel with glass-card and glow.
- [ ] Opportunity flow renders as a vertical timeline (spine top-to-bottom, stops alternating left-right).
- [ ] Each timeline stop has a ghost-bordered story panel (on the same side as the stage node) containing a contextual mini-visualization on top and a narrative callout (2-3 data-driven bullets) stacked below, separated by a divider. Ghost border uses `--callout-border` token (blue in dark, salmon in light).
- [ ] Mini-visualization size scales proportionally with stage item count.
- [ ] Callout bullets are dynamically computed from stage data (not static copy).
- [ ] Chapter controls (Flow/Friction/Outcomes) override contextual defaults — all stops switch to the same dimension for comparison.
- [ ] Terminal outcome branches fan out from the spine's bottom point (root of the trunk), not from the last stage node.
- [ ] KPI band renders as inline flat content in the story canvas zone (no card borders).
- [ ] Period selector (30d/90d/180d/365d) synchronizes all data sources.
- [ ] Collapsible left nav and right Neuron rail work with adaptive canvas width.
- [ ] Dashboard feels like a framed canvas — app chrome is flush to viewport edges, main content sits in a bordered inset container (sidebar-08 pattern, 0.75rem gap, rounded corners), panels float inside, story zone narrates.

### Session 3 PM Verification (2026-03-17)

Verified against Session 2 evidence:
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/qe-2026-03-17.md`
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/security-2026-03-17.md`
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/code-review-2026-03-17.md`

Verification result:
- Acceptance criteria are not yet satisfied for closeout.
- Blocking gaps remain in QE and Code Review gates (contrast, visual test determinism/portability, decomposition completion).
- Security gate is conditional pass with scanner/tooling follow-ups pending.

### Session 4 PM Verification (2026-03-19)

Verified against current repo state plus:
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/pm-2026-03-19.md`
- commits `09d23be` and `7482207`

Verification result:
- Acceptance criteria are still not validated for final closeout.
- At review time, required signoff evidence had not been refreshed after the 2026-03-18 and 2026-03-19 implementation changes.
- At review time, the feature package remained incomplete for closeout (`S-DASH-002` missing; `GETTING-STARTED.md` stale against implementation).

### Session 5 Gate Rerun (2026-03-19)

Verified against refreshed gate evidence:
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/qe-2026-03-19.md`
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/code-review-2026-03-19.md`
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/security-2026-03-19.md`
- `planning-mds/operations/evidence/f0013/devops-2026-03-19.md`

Verification result:
- Acceptance criteria are still not validated for final closeout.
- QE remains blocked / non-pass because backend regression execution hits `MSB3021` and the frontend toolchain is unstable in the current workspace.
- Code Review remains rejected on unresolved contrast, decomposition, palette-token, and proxy portability findings.
- Security remains conditional pass because scanner coverage and targeted authz rerun are incomplete.
- DevOps signoff is now evidenced, but it is a fail because clean frontend/backend build proof is still missing in this workspace.

### Decision Gate Outcome (2026-03-17)

- Option A selected by user: mark F0013 Done and keep active folder.
- Done status is recorded as a product-owner override with known unresolved gate findings preserved in `STATUS.md`.

## UX / Screens

| Screen | Purpose | Key Actions |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Dashboard — Framed Storytelling Canvas | Three-layer canvas: frame + operational panels + story timeline | Dismiss nudge, switch period, switch chapter, hover/click stage radial, open drilldown, scroll to activity/tasks |

**Formal screen specification:** `planning-mds/screens/S-DASH-002-framed-storytelling-canvas.md`

**Visual references:**
- Original handdrawn wireframe: `planning-mds/screens/handdrawn.jpeg`
- Current implementation (light): `planning-mds/screens/temp/MacBook Pro-1773533878403.jpeg`
- Current implementation (dark): `planning-mds/screens/temp/MacBook Pro-1773533934943.jpeg`

**Key Workflows:**
1. **Alert-to-Story Scan** — User sees nudge cards (raised, glowing) at top, scans KPI band, scrolls the vertical timeline reading each stop's contextual mini-visual.
2. **Stage Story Reading** — Each timeline stop tells its own story: "Who submitted?" at Received (bar chart), "Are we on track?" at Triaging (SLA gauge), "What mix?" at Quote Prep (donut). No interaction needed — the story is visible on the timeline itself.
3. **Per-Stop Exploration** — User toggles a stop's alternate view (e.g., geographic map at Received, wait time by broker at Waiting on Broker) to explore a different dimension at that specific stage.
4. **Uniform Comparison Mode** — User switches chapters (e.g., Friction); all stops switch to the same dimension (dwell time bands) for cross-stage comparison; per-stop toggles are hidden.
5. **Action Handoff** — User scrolls past the timeline to Activity and My Tasks (raised panels with depth) and executes follow-up work.

### Contextual Mini-Visualization Per Stage (Default — No Chapter Override)

Each stop has a chart type chosen to answer the most meaningful question for that stage:

```text

### Chapter Override Mode (All Stops Switch to Same Dimension)

When a chapter is active, ALL stops switch from their contextual defaults to a uniform visualization for cross-stage comparison:

```text
Chapter: Friction (all stops show dwell time — per-stop toggles hidden)
     ● Received    [donut: <1d ██ | 1-3d ██ | 3-7d ██ | 7d+ ██]
     ● Triaging    [donut: <1d ██ | 1-3d ██ | 3-7d ██ | 7d+ ██]   ← emphasis ring: bottleneck
     ● UW Review   [donut: <1d ██ | 1-3d ██ | 3-7d ██ | 7d+ ██]   ← emphasis ring: blocked
     ● Quoted      [donut: <1d ██ | 1-3d ██ | 3-7d ██ | 7d+ ██]
     ...
```

## Stage-to-Visualization Mapping (Default Context)

Each stage has a **primary** mini-visualization (shown by default) and optional **alternates** the user can toggle per-stop. The primary answers the most important question for that stage; alternates offer different angles. A small dot/chevron indicator on the mini-visual lets the user cycle through available views.

| Stage | Primary (default) | Alternate 1 | Alternate 2 |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Received | Icon grid / waffle chart — "What kind of work?" (insurance type icons: property, casualty, marine, etc.) | Mini bar chart (top brokers by volume) | Geographic map (submission origins) |
| Triaging | SLA gauge/arc — "Are we triaging on time?" | Geographic map (regional SLA variance) | — |
| Waiting on Broker | Progress ring — "How long are we waiting?" | Bar chart (wait time by broker) | — |
| UW Review | Donut — "Who is reviewing?" (UW workload) | Bar chart (by line of business) | — |
| Quote Preparation | Stacked bar — "What kind of work?" (subs vs renewals) | Donut (by program) | — |
| Quoted | Donut — "Conversion potential?" (quote-to-bind rate) | Bar chart (quote age distribution) | — |
| Bind Requested | Count badge — "Almost there" | — | — |
| Terminal outcomes | Count + percentage labels | — | — |

**Toggle behavior:** Per-stop, not global. Chapter override (S0004) hides per-stop toggles and shows uniform views. Returning to Flow chapter restores the last-selected alternate.

## Chapter Override Mapping

When a chapter is active, contextual defaults are replaced with a uniform dimension across ALL stops. Per-stop alternate toggles (S0003) are hidden during chapter override.

| Chapter | All Stops Show | Chart Type (uniform) | Overlay Behavior |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Flow** (default) | Contextual per-stage defaults + per-stop alternate toggles | Mixed (per table above) | No override — each stop tells its own story; user can toggle alternates per-stop |
| **Friction** | Dwell time bands (<1d, 1-3d, 3-7d, 7d+) | Donut (uniform) | Emphasis rings on nodes (bottleneck/blocked/active); per-stop toggles hidden |
| **Outcomes** | N/A (highlights terminal branches) | N/A | Terminal branch paths glow; stage mini-visuals dim; per-stop toggles hidden |

> **Why only 3 chapters?** Aging and mix dimensions (age buckets, broker/program breakdown) are available as per-stop alternate views (S0003). Chapters are reserved for cross-stage comparison modes that require timeline-level overlays (emphasis rings, terminal branch highlighting) — things per-stop toggles can't do.

## Data Requirements

**Core Entities:**
- Nudge/action items (overdue tasks, items requiring attention) — existing endpoint
- KPI aggregates (active brokers, open submissions, renewal rate, avg turnaround) — existing endpoint with `periodDays` parameter
- Opportunities stage aggregates with sequence metadata and connection strengths — existing endpoint
- Flow node friction data (avgDwellDays, emphasis) — added in F0012 backend
- Terminal outcome aggregates (outcome_type, count, percent_of_exits, avg_days_to_exit) — existing endpoint
- Aging bucket matrix — existing endpoint
- Hierarchy/mix data — existing endpoint
- Timeline activity feed and user task queue — existing endpoints

**New Frontend Data Needs (no new endpoints):**
- Radial popover data is derived from existing stage aggregates by cross-referencing with entity-type counts, aging buckets, or hierarchy data depending on active chapter.
- The radial composition is a frontend computation layering chapter-specific data onto stage-level aggregates.

**Validation Rules:**
- Counts and rates are non-negative and scoped by role policy.
- Stage and outcome ordering remains deterministic (displayOrder).
- Chapter switches do not change period scope.
- Radial popover segments must sum to the stage's total count.
- Collapsed rail state must not hide actionable controls.

## Role-Based Access

| Role | Access Level | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| DistributionUser | Read | ABAC scoped dashboard visibility |
| DistributionManager | Read | ABAC scoped dashboard visibility |
| Underwriter | Read | ABAC scoped dashboard visibility |
| RelationshipManager | Read | ABAC scoped dashboard visibility |
| ProgramManager | Read | ABAC scoped dashboard visibility |
| Admin | Read | Internal unscoped |
| BrokerUser | Denied | Dashboard remains InternalOnly |

## Success Criteria

- Dashboard feels like a framed canvas — app chrome encloses it, operational panels have depth and glow, story zone tells the narrative.
- Users hover timeline stage nodes and see radial chart popovers showing composition, not just counts.
- Switching chapters changes all mini-visualizations uniformly — users can diagnose friction or focus on outcomes from the same timeline bar.
- Per-stop alternate toggles let users explore aging, mix, geography, and other dimensions at individual stops.
- Nudge cards, Activity, and My Tasks panels have the glass-card depth and soft hover glow from the design system.
- No regression in period synchronization, rail adaptation, or responsive behavior.

## Risks & Assumptions

- **Risk:** Radial chart popovers may feel crowded on stages with very low counts (0 or 1). **Mitigation:** Popovers degrade to a simple count tooltip when a stage has fewer than 2 items.
- **Risk:** Multiple interaction modes (per-stop toggles + chapter override) could confuse users. **Mitigation:** Chapter override hides per-stop toggles entirely, making modes mutually exclusive. Clear chapter label in the controls zone.
- **Assumption:** Existing backend endpoints provide sufficient data granularity to compute radial segments per chapter without new endpoints.
- **Assumption:** Radial/donut chart rendering can use a lightweight SVG approach without adding a heavy charting library.

## Dependencies

- F0012 backend changes (periodDays on KPIs, avgDwellDays + emphasis on flow nodes) — **Done (archived)**
- F0010 opportunities refactor baseline (Pipeline Board + aging/hierarchy endpoints) — **Done**
- Design tokens in `planning-mds/screens/design-tokens.md` — glass-card, glow utilities, editorial accent palette (coral/steel-blue)
- Existing ABAC policy coverage for `dashboard_kpi`, `dashboard_pipeline`, `dashboard_nudge`
