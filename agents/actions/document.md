# Action: Document

## User Intent

Generate comprehensive technical documentation including API documentation, README files, runbooks, and developer guides based on implemented code and architecture.

## Agent Flow

```
Technical Writer
  ↓
[SELF-REVIEW GATE: Validate documentation quality and accuracy]
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews documentation]
  ↓
Document Complete
```

**Flow Type:** Single agent with review gate

---

## Runtime Execution Boundary

- The builder runtime orchestrates documentation flow and gates; it remains stack-agnostic.
- Documentation that references runtime behavior (API examples, CLI commands, health checks) should be verified against application runtime containers when possible.
- The Technical Writer inspects code artifacts but does not compile or execute them — any execution validation runs in application runtime containers.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Documentation Planning

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Technical Writer agent** by reading `agents/technical-writer/SKILL.md`

2. **Read context:**
   - `planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (project overview, architecture)
   - `planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - `planning-mds/architecture/decisions/` (ADRs)
   - `planning-mds/api/` (OpenAPI/API contracts)
   - `planning-mds/features/` (feature folders with stories)
   - Existing documentation in the project
   - Codebase: API controllers, database schema, configuration, Docker setup

3. **Determine documentation scope from user input:**
   - `api` — API reference documentation
   - `readme` — README files (root and component)
   - `runbooks` — operational runbooks
   - `guides` — developer guides
   - `feature:{slug}` — documentation for a specific feature
   - `all` — comprehensive documentation (default)

4. **Produce documentation plan:**
   ```markdown
   # Documentation Plan

   Scope: [scope from user input]
   Target Audience: [developers / operators / end users]
   Date: [Date]

   ## Documents to Create/Update
   | Document | Type | Status | Location |
   |----------|------|--------|----------|
   | Root README.md | README | Create/Update | ./README.md |
   | API Reference | API Docs | Create | docs/api/ |
   | Deployment Runbook | Runbook | Create | docs/runbooks/deployment.md |

   ## Source Material
   - API contracts: [list files]
   - Architecture: [list files]
   - Code: [list key directories]
   ```

## Documentation Best Practices

### API Documentation
- ✅ Use OpenAPI/Swagger standard
- ✅ Include realistic examples with actual field values
- ✅ Document error scenarios with ProblemDetails responses
- ✅ Keep in sync with code (regenerate when endpoints change)
- ❌ Don't use generic descriptions ("Gets data")
- ❌ Don't skip error documentation

### README Files
- ✅ Start with quick start (clone-to-running)
- ✅ Use clear headings and numbered steps
- ✅ Include working, copy-pasteable commands
- ❌ Don't assume prior knowledge of the stack
- ❌ Don't skip prerequisites

### Runbooks
- ✅ Use numbered step-by-step format
- ✅ Include verification steps after each major action
- ✅ Add troubleshooting tips for common failures
- ✅ Document rollback procedures
- ❌ Don't use ambiguous language ("usually works")
- ❌ Don't skip edge cases

### Developer Guides
- ✅ Explain the "why" not just "how"
- ✅ Use diagrams for architecture
- ✅ Link to related docs (don't duplicate)
- ❌ Don't duplicate README content
- ❌ Don't overwhelm with implementation details

## Related Actions

- **After:** [build action](./build.md) or [feature action](./feature.md) — document after building
- **With:** [blog action](./blog.md) — docs for reference, blogs for narrative
- **Continuous:** Update docs when code changes

---

## Notes

- Documentation should be versioned with code
- Keep docs close to code (co-located when possible)
- Automate API doc generation from code annotations when available
- Test all commands and examples in docs before finalizing
- Consider documentation as part of the Definition of Done
- Update docs in the same PR as code changes
